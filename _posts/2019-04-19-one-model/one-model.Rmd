title: "One Model to Rule Them All"
description: |
  The machine learning community focuses too much on predictive performance. But machine learning models are always a small part of a complex system. This post discusses our obsession with finding the best model and emphasizes what we should do instead: Take a step back and see the bigger picture in which the machine learning model is embedded.

<!-- Story-->
*A quiet night, somewhere in Germany.
Most people were ready to go to bed.
Not me.
I had to train machine learning models.
I was competing online with obsessed people from all over the world about whose machine learning model could make the best preditions.
My computer fans were huming, dictated by the rythm of my fingers on the keyboard.
My current model was ranked somewhere in the middle of the public leaderboard.
Pathetic.
The model actually did an OK-ish job.
But OK-ish wasn't the goal of this exercise.
Outperforming everyone elses model was.
Better feature engineering and better learning algorithms should get me there.
I had a promising idea for creating new features and using boosted trees instead of random forests.
It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
I promised myself to go to bed afterwards.*

*Hours passed.
It was 3:30 in the morning, when I was finally ready to submit another prediction, getting another shot at the leaderboard.
Full of hope, I hit the submit button.
I was so tired that I saw only a blurry version of the loading screen that told me that the predictions were being evaluated.
Would I rise on the leaderboard?
I dared to hope.
Could I reach the top 10%?
The actual results quickly crushed my hopes and doubled my fatigue.
Not only had I not risen on the leaderboard, but my latest model performed worse than before.
A bug in the code?
Overfitting?
Did I upload the wrong prediction file?
My rational self finally took control over my body and managed to put me to bed.
I sleeped restlessly and dreamed of ever evolving decision trees that I would never comprehend.*

# Blinders Removed
<!-- Personal view -->
I had a few of those late-night machine learning competition sessions, but it's over now, for two reasons.
First, I value sleep so much more now. 
Second, my understanding of machine learning has changed dramatically.

When I started out with machine learning, I thought the most important about machine learning is that the model performs really, really well.
And to achieve that, my sole focus would have to be on learning more algorithms, feature engineering tricks and evaluation techniques that would get that damn model error down.

Today, I have a rather different view.
I think that machine learning is a lot more than loss minimization.
And in some ways, model fitting is even the easiest part, because there is a huge amount of literature, educational material, practical exercises and excellent software for it.
I believe machine learning as a field, is quite mature now in fitting models.
But all around the model fitting part, we have to deal with very difficult questions, like:

- How do we translate problems into prediction tasks?
- How do we create trust into the prediction models?
- Is the training data biased? Will it be similar to the application data?
- How do I debug a machine learning models if something goes wrong?
- How do (wrong) predictions affect users / the product?
- Are there harmful feedback loops between predictions and future training data?
- How will a static model perform in a dynamic environment?

My hypothesis is that the machine learning community is, on average, still focused too much on the game of model optimization.
But the community is waking up and realizing that there is much more to it.
Topics like system thinking, interpretability, fairness, social impact, the role of the data and so on are getting more attention.


# The Allure of the Model

*An anecdote from my early machine learning career:
When I started to work on machine learning applications in a startup, I wasn't such a good coder compared to my team members.
But I asked many questions, for example whether the training data would match the later application data.
My mentor praised me for those questions.
I dismissed the praise, since my imposter syndrom for not knowing how to program in Scala was stronger. 
Also I thought that learning how to built stronger prediction models was more important.
Only now can I fully appreciate my mentors praise.*

<!-- Hard for beginners -->
It took me around 5 years to fully realize how small the role of fitting the best model is in machine learning.
Why did it take so long? 
Short answer: Machine learning education and research focuses too much on the "best" model, and trivializes the role of data, the human component and the complex interplay of the prediction model with its environment.

For the long answer, let's look through the eyes of a hypothetical newcomer to machine learning.
Her name is Anna, she is currently doing her Master studies in electrical engineering and has a solid understanding of the mathematical basics and programing skills in C and Python.
To kickstart her machine learning career, she starts with [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), and reads the book [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
Like most other educational materials, they are essentially listing one type of model after the other, with the focus on the underlying math.
No words spent on how to think about data, social impact, ethical considerations, model interpretation, application contexts and so on.
She encounters some application examples, but they are neatly packaged toy examples.

At some point, she start competing in [kaggle competitions](kaggle.com).
Again she finds nicely packaged prediction problems, batteries included: 
Behind the scences kaggle has already done the hard job of finding a company with data and a problem, translating a problem into a prediction task, figuring out which data can be used, possibly doing some data cleanup and merging, deciding on a performance metric, ...
For the actual machine learning competition, this leaves some feature engineering and, of course, finding the best model!
And who gets the money in the end?
Not to the team with a well performing, interpretable model.
Not to the team with a model that trains in seconds instead of days.
Not to the team with a model might that would actually have a chance to be used in production.
The money goes to the teams with the best models. 
Her believes that machine learning really is just finding the best model are getting cemented.
I mean, clearly, these are visibly the winners that attract money.

Her passion for machine learning is ignited.
She wants to rank higher in the next competition!
Fortunately, the machine learning community is really great and open.
She makes use of the many blog posts about how to get better performing models and clones github repos of the latest machine learning libraries.
She has finally understood: 
Machine learning is about fitting the best model.

She realizes how young the field of machine learning is and how closely the research community and the industry are connected.
To get an edge, she wants to read papers on machine learning.
But where to start? 
Well, papers with the most citations of course!
Which papers would that be?
Well, of course the one focused [on models and frameworks.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/03/top-20-deep-learning-papers-2018.html). 
^[Any application paper cites the methods and tools it uses, so naturally papers introducing widely used models or computation frameworks are cited often.]
The dangerously simplistic message throughout her journey is that to become good at machine learning, you have to only master the modeling algorithms (and a bit feature engineering).


# What Matters in Machine Learning

<!-- What matters -->
If winning a kaggle competition is not enough to become a machine learning expert, then what else is there to know?
IMHO the following topics are completely undervalued and deserve way more attention from the machine learning community.

- **Problem Formulation**: Translate a problem into a prediction or pattern recognition problem.
- **Data-Generating Process**: Understand the data, its limitations and suitability for sovling the problem.
- **Model Interpretation**: Analyze the model beyond cross-validated performance estimates.
- **Application Context**: Reflect how the model will interact with the world.
- **Model Deployment**: Integrate the model into a product or process.

This list is non-exhaustive. 
Leave a comment if you think something is missing.

You can have the best performing model, but mess up one of the mentioned points and your model will be useless or even harmful.
When the training data does not match application data, the model might be completely useless.
When management rejects the model because it's a black box, you have to go back to the drawing board.
When you find out that the model has a racial bias, you better not use it.

If you get problem formulation, data, interpretaton, context and deployment right, the project will be a great success, even if the model performance is only so-so, compared to some super-tuned stacked ensemble method that goes to the trash bin.

# Easy to Get it Wrong

Let me share a story where a machine learning model performed well, but achieved the opposite of what people wanted.
A friend of mine worked for a telecom company that sells, among other things, mobile contracts (telephone, sms, data).
He was in the company's data science team and he was involved in a project to predict which customers are most likely to quit their mobile contracts.
The goal was to prevent those customers from leaving by offering them better deals.
So the team went ahead and built a machine learning that worked quite well in detecting those customers.
They scored each customer and sent lists of those customers to another team that was responsible for actually contacting the customers and offering them better contracts.
And the results?
Well, the number of cancellation INCREASED instead of declined. 
Why?   
The theory was that the customers that were contacted were reminded of their mobile contracts they wanted to quit.
The email they received acted as a trigger to finally cancel their contract and go to another provider.  
What was the problem?  
It starts with how the problem was translated into a prediction problem.
The model predicted "How likely is customer X to leave?".
But it should have been "How likely is customer X to leave when we send him an e-mail". 
The issue can also be seen as a problem with the application context.
There hasn't been enough reflection about the consequences when you send emails to people who are likely to quit their contract with you.
This story is a case gets an A+ for model building, F for problem formulation and context.


# You Are In Good Company

<!-- Big players get it wrong -->
Certainly, only beginners make such mistakes with machine learning for real tasks?
Well, no.
The best start to learn machine learning beyond model fitting the hard way is by working on real world projects.
But your journey doesn't end there.
You have to WANT to become better in the machine learning topics that have nothing to do with model optimization.
Experience alone is not enough. 
Companies with a strong focus on ML like Google or Amazon should have mastered machine learning beyond optimization a long time ago.
Well, they haven't.
With all their PhDs, all their money, all their experience, all their data, all their technical expertise, they haven't figured it out yet.
Instead, they make very dumb mistakes still.
Because machine learning is hard.

Examples of big companies failing at machine learning:

- [The Google Photos app tagged people as "Gorillas".](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai).
Their solution was to not predict the tag 'Gorillas' any longer. 
That's like when you have mold on your wall and you paint it instead of fixing the underlying issue.
- [Google Flu Trends over-estimated flu occurence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flu_Trends). 
They pulled the product. 
It worked by correlating search terms with flu occurence, which seems to have picked up non-causal terms like "high school basketball". 
- [Amazon built a hiring tool with gender bias](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G). 
It was trained with their own hiring data and the model simply picked up historical bias by Amazon.
The tool was never used.
The narrative around this is that now it's fine, because they don't use the tool, ignoring that the gender-bias is probably still there. 
Again, painting a molded wall white.

# Simplify Your Life with Numbers!

Work is frustrating without feedback telling you whether you do the right thing and how well you do it.
Especially in academia or when you are without a boss, it's common to wonder whether you are doing the most meaningful thing at the moment.
Having a boss who tells you what to do might feel easier, but let me tell you a secret: They too usually have no idea what they are doing.
Work feels more rewarding when you can measure how well you did.
A proxy of success.  

"Today I read 5 papers."  
"This week I finished a 10 pages report."  
"This month my website had 10k visitors."  
"This year I received a bonus of 20k."  

To some degree, measuring success is a great method to make work simpler and more efficient.
But those number always oversimplify success.
It's impossible to squeeze all criteria into a few numbers.

You are highly paid, but hate your job. Are you successful?  
Your papers are getting cited very often, but you still have no real world impact. Are you successful?  
You have thousands of followers, but nobody engages with your content. Are you successful?  
You score high on the competition leaderboard, but as many other competitors, you are making use of a data leakage. Are you successful?  

It is difficult to know when to "chase" a number and when not to.
It is my believe that the trade-off between "chasing numbers" and doing non-measurable work (like doing research on a new product instead of selling more of the old) is heavily tipped towards chasing numbers in our society.
Also in the machine learning community.

The picture I have in mind when I think about someone "chasing numbers" is a racing horse.
A beautiful, strong horse that is trained to run really fast. 
At the end, when it did a good job, it gets carrots (Not sure if horses particularly like carrots, but let's pretend carrots are their favorite thing).
To fully concentrate on the target (the number), they wear blinders that reduce their field of vision so that they don't see what's happening left and right of them.
We are the horses, and we wear the blinders when we blindly chase the metrics.
But sometimes, if we were to look left or right, we would see an untouched carrot field.

As a community, we are playing a wrong game of machine learning since a long time. 
We have to get rid of our blinders.
With this blog, I hope to make a contribution towards removing those blinders and to shift the focus away from model performance towards data, interpretability, application context and social impact.

<!-- The number of gifts is limited, so you build a machine learning model to predict which user is most likely to sign up for a premium account based. -->
<!-- You deploy the model and notice that users successfully sign up, but are very likely to cancel their subscription at the earliest possible moment. -->

<!-- Also a lack of interpretability of machine learning models is an obstacle in many institutions. -->
<!-- I have heard from many analysts and data scientists that they couldn't use machine learning approaches because they couldn't explain their behavior. -->

<!-- In one of my projects I had to build a classifer that classifies short documents. -->
<!-- The classifier had to be implemented later by the backend team. -->
<!-- They didn't use Python or R, the languages in which I develop models, but Go, which didn't have machine learning libraries (at that time). -->
<!-- So for the model to be deployed I had to train a model that could be easily serialized, handed over to the backend team and implemented by them.  -->
<!-- I chose a decision tree. -->
<!-- It would have been much more difficult to do the same with a neural network. -->


<!-- And I want to use this blog also to right about topics related to interpretability, but also go more into the direction of the data generating process. -->
<!-- I want to provide a perspective beyond model optimization. -->
