<!-- The Problem -->

## Performance Optimization: The "Sushi" of Machine Learning

Fitting the best model is in some way a very satisfying task, because you get hard feedback through the score.
And it's easy, very easy to get fixated on that number and forget about what the data means, what the context of the appliciation is and to have insights into what the heck the model does.
When I started to learn about machine learning, I was like that, only learning about software/algorithms/tuning methods and so on that would give me the best predictions.

<!-- many are still like that -->
A big part of the machine learning community is still focused very much on the optimization part. 
Look at research papers in the deep learning space that try to beat the same benchmarks over and over.
Look at machine learning online courses and blog posts. 
Their focus is on mathematical foundation for the models, models, tuning, performance estimation.
Look at kaggle. (TBH, they are getting better through kernels and such).
Learning all that stuff takes time and is not super easy.
Especially for beginners it's hard, because - depending on prior knowledge - it's a challenge to understand the math behind all those algorithms, to learn programing and other computer skills.
Your first contacts with machine learning are very algorithm-focused MOOCs (or university classes), technical books, toy-examples with always the same datasets and later maybe research paper, which are also usually focused on algorithms.
The first time you realize that the model fitting itself is the easist part of your work is when you work on a real-world machine learning task. 
Suddenly you are confronted with questions that you never encountered before:

- How can we formulate a problem as a prediction model so that a machine learning algorithm can solve it?
- What data should I use? Will training data and the "live" application data be similar enough? Is there some bias?
- What did my model learn? Do I trust it enough to deploy it in production?
- How will my model affect its users?

* And no, kaggle competitions do not count as fully-blown real-world machine learning task. 
Much is happening in the background: 
Choosing a problem. 
Translate it into an ML problem. 
Find the right data. 


And these things are often problem-specific, but most importantly they are hard, very hard.
So hard that even the creme de la creme of clever people at big corporations like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, made pretty dumb mistakes.

My kaggle time is a while back now, and my narrow view on what is part of machine learning has expanded a lot.

To be fair to kaggle, they have expanded a lot into this direction with kernels and data set. 
<!-- Why is it such a problem? -->



<!-- The Solution -->


## Machine Learning is a Bento Box

This - kind of addictive - model training (loss minimization) is like Sashimi, a kind of Sushi. 
Sashimi is a Japanese dish, which consists of raw fish and raw fish only.
Pure, (literally) raw, simple and perfect.
(If you don't like raw fish, insert some food you like a lot.)
Machine learning is like Sushi, or rather Sashimi.
It's very tasty.

It’s easy to get the impression that machine learning consists of finding the best machine learning model. Especially if you take part in competitions. 
You can’t have Sashimi all the time, but for a healthy diet you have to add a variety of foods. 
The same is true for machine learning projects. Machine learning models optimization is just one part of it. 
The model has a context, lots of context actually. 
It comes from data, affects decisions, influences human behaviour, has unintended consequences, is embedded in a product or process.


In real life, machine learning  projects need a lot more ingredients to be successful:

- Finding a meaningful optimization goal in the first place.
- Good, unbiased, goal-relevant data
- Model interpretation.
- Ethical considerations.
- The context of the application.
- The people it affects.

- Considering the data generating process (biases, anyone?)
- Considering the context and possible second-order effects
- Actually looking into the black box model

Moving again to Japanese food (yummy!), machine learning should be better thought of as a bento box. 
A bento box is a box with many compartments with a variety of foods. 
The machine learning model is just one part of those ingredients.
I want to use the bentoML blog as a platform to speak about those machine learning topics that go beyond model fitting.
This means expect to learn about interpretability of machine learning models, how to think about your training data and to better put the model into it's context.

As you might, know, I am writing a book about Interpretable Machine Learning, which is another part of the bento box. 

One of the other most important parts is the data that comes into this
