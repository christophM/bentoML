The good times. 
Staying up late, slurping energy drink.
Having more ideas, building more features, running that new model, uploading it. 
Crossing the fingers, hoping to climb on that kaggle leaderboard.
(Only to realize that you actually made your model worse,  then go to bad and have bad dreams.)
It's fun, it's adddicitive.
Like a slot machine where you want to have a higher score, and eventually earn lots of money.
It fits perfect into our current design of the world, where we optimize stuff, try to hit monthly goals at work, 
get that body weight to a certain number, track how much we sleep.
Understanding machine learning methods, their in's and out, getting cross validation, optimization and so on takes time and is not super easy.
But once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite easy, almost stupid, you are simply chasing the best score.
The most juicy part might even be feature engineering or how you frame the problem. 
But once you have that there is not much to do, because it can even be automated,  see emerging frameworks like autoxgboost or H20.

This - kind of addictive - model training (loss minimization) is like Sashimi. 
Pure, (literally) raw, simple and perfect.
(If you don't like raw fish, insert some food you like a lot.)
 Machine learning is like Sushi, or rather Sashimi.
Sashimi is a Japanese dish, which consists of raw fish.
It's very tasty.

It's easy to get the impression that machine learning consists of finding the best machine learning model.
Especially if you take part in competitions.
You can't have Sashimi all the time, but for a healthy diet you have to add a variety of foods.
The same is true for machine learning projects.
Machine learning models optimization is just one part of it.
The model has a context, lots of context actually.
It comes from data, affects decisions, influences human behaviour, has unintended consequences, is embedded in a product or process.

In real life, machine learning  projects need a lot more ingredients to be successful:

- Finding a meaningful optimization goal in the first place.
- Good, unbiased, goal-relevant data
- Model interpretation.
- Ethical considerations.
- The context of the application.
- The people it affects.

Moving again to Japanese food (yummy!), the best analogue is a bento box. 
A bento box is a box with many compartments with a variety of foods. 
The machine learning model is just one part of those ingredients.

As you might, know, I am writing a book about Interpretable Machine Learning, which is another part of the bento box. 

One of the other most important parts is the data that comes into this
