Optimizing the hell out of a problem can be fun.
Like Kaggle type of fun. 
Rising on the ladder, making the machine learning model more and more accurate.
Machine learning is like Sushi, or rather Sashimi.
Sashimi is a Japanese dish, which consists of raw fish.
It's very tasty.
<aside>
If you don't like fish, just think of some other food.

TODO: ADD aside-tag with Sashimi

It's easy to get the impression that machine learning consists of finding the best machine learning model.
Especially if you take part in competitions.
You can't have Sashimi all the time, but for a healthy diet you have to add a variety of foods.
The same is true for machine learning projects.
Machine learning models optimization is just one part of it.
The model has a context, lots of context actually.
It comes from data, affects decisions, influences human behaviour, has unintended consequences, is embedded in a product or process.

In real life, machine learning  projects need a lot more ingredients to be successful:

- Finding a meaningful optimization goal in the first place.
- Good, unbiased, goal-relevant data
- Model interpretation.
- Ethical considerations.
- The context of the application.
- The people it affects.

Moving again to Japanese food (yummy!), the best analogue is a bento box. 
A bento box is a box with many compartments with a variety of foods. 
The machine learning model is just one part of those ingredients.

TODO: aside with bento box.

TODO: aside with bento-box with data science stuff.


As you might, know, I am writing a book about Interpretable Machine Learning, which is another part of the bento box. 

One of the other most important parts is the data that comes into this
