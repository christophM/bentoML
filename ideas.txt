<!-- Storytime -->

It's dark outside.
Everyone is asleep, only lights in one window of the block is lit.
Inside it, computer fans hum quietly, cooling the stressed CPUs.
The clicking of keys on the keyboard
Quietly humming computer fans, the clicking of the keyboard, a sip of coffee during an otherwise quiet night.
While others sleep in their bed, or are drinking in a bar, I am building machine learning models to climb the kaggle leaderboard.
Ah ... good times.
Just building one more feature, tuning one more model, testing this other approach before I go to bed.
Hours drag on before I am ready to submit another prediction to the leaderboard.
It's 3 AM in the morning, when I hit the submit button.
My sleepy eyes show me a blurry version of the loading screen.
Disappointment sweeps through me, when kaggle shows me that the thing I just did actually performed a lot worse.
Do I try this other idea I had?
Exhaustion finally forces me to go to bed, where I dream of mathematical transformations of features and ever evolving data tables during a restless sleep.
