# bentoML Blog

bentoML is a blog about machine learning beyond model optimization.
Machine learning models rely on data, implicit assumptions and have a context, yet many people focus on the model fitting as in performance optimization and it is easy to ignore such things.
We will talk here about the difficult parts in machine leanrning.
The name bentoML is inspired by the japanese "bento box", a lunch box with many different dishes.
Model fitting (or training/optimization) is just one "dish" in the box, but machine learning consists of much more: the data, the context, the people it affects  and so on.

# Christoph Molnar
I am a data scientist and PhD candidate in interpretable machine learning. 
I am passionate about using statistics and machine learning on data to make humans and machines smarter.
And I am especially interested in making the decisions from algorithms more understandable for humans.
