# bentoML Blog

bentoML is a blog about machine learning beyond model optimization.
Machine learning models always have a context and rely on data and implicit assumptions, yet many people focus on model performance.
The name bentoML is inspired by the Japanese "bento box", a lunch box with many different dishes.
Predictive performance is just one of many dishes in the box.
In this blog, we will discuss topics that go beyond performance: machine learning interpretability, data biases, application context, fairness and more.

# Christoph Molnar
I am a data scientist and PhD candidate in interpretable machine learning. 
I am passionate about using statistics and machine learning on data to make humans and machines smarter.
And I am especially interested in making the decisions from algorithms more understandable for humans.
